What is Zend Server?
====================
Zend Server is a complete, enterprise-ready Web Application Server for running 
and managing PHP applications that require a high level of reliability, 
performance and security. 

What is this Package?
=====================
The Linux Repository Installation Script package includes a simple shell script
that automates the process of installing and upgrading Zend Server through 
Zend's DEB or RPM repositories. 

On supported Linux distributions (see detailed system requirements below), 
running the ./install_zs.sh script included in this package will perform the 
following:

* Add Zend's repository to the list of your package manager's (yum or aptitude) 
  sources list

* If applicable, install Zend's PGP key that will be used to verify the 
  integrity of downloaded packages before installing them

* Install Zend Server on your system 

Once the installation is complete, you will be able to use your package manager 
(e.g. yum, aptitude, apt-get etc.) to install additional packages from Zend, 
update your installation or uninstall packages.

The script upgrades your Zend Server and PHP versions, according to your 
current configurations and target version passed.
The script supports the following upgrades:
